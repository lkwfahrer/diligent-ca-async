# Async Javascript

## Tasks

This project consist of demo and code blocks. If you need to do some task
individually you will find these tasks in the `*_code` folders.

To execute any JS file in Node.js , navigate to its folder, and start the
task from there. E.g.

```sh
cd 2_code
node task1.js
```

To execute the JS files in the browser, the easiest way if you
install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VC Code extension, and click on the 
"Go Live" toolbar "button" at bottom right corner of the editor
when the HTML file is opened and active.

You can solve and execute the tasks in the same file.
